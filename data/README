[DESCRIPTION]
IGC-Books is a part of the IGC-Project (Icelandic Gigaword corpus) 
[https://igc.arnastofnun.is] that aims to collect as much as possible of 
Icelandic texts that can be published, under an open or restricted licence. 
IGC-Books contains texts from books that have been published in Iceland. The 
corpus is published in two versions. IGC-Books contains plain text while 
IGC-Book.ana is linguistically marked-up versions. 

This corpus contains the annotated version of IGC-Books. The unannotated version 
can be found here: http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.12537/316  

The texts have been split into parts that do not include more than 500 words and 
reordered in a random way. Paragraphs are not dismantled unless they contain more 
than 500 words. If a text contains less than 5000 words, sentences of each paragraph 
are also rearranged. In some instances, we have removed fragments from texts, for 
example, if we did not have permission from the author of that fragment or if the 
fragment was not in Icelandic. 

Further information about IGC is available at http://igc.arnastofnun.is.
